map-reduce report.

serial version of the program is called wordCount.py and the parallel version is mrp.py.
after several attempts to make the program in parallel run as the serial version.
 I finally get it to work and show consistent result to be able to present it.
the major advantages I see are that running the parallel version i have a better understanding about the cpu
and how it perform processes.   I was able to make the program run just a liitle faster than the serial version.
setting the locks and placing the parrallel portion was a really hard task to tackle but finally after several attempts it was done.
i see a gread change in times from one thead up to 6 threads  then passing 8 threads the program was running e n 23 times as fast as a single tread.
 the cpuinfo and the result of the test are in two different files called cpuinfo and 
   -output.txt

update.   the final working version of the MPI map reduce is called mpi-final-working-version.py. it needs to import the maphelper.py class. also the txt files must be inside a folder called files.
